## Optimization Plan: `generate_gem_art` Function

This document outlines potential optimizations for the `generate_gem_art` function, based on the results of our performance benchmarks. The primary goal is to reduce the execution time of this function, particularly when dealing with a large number of colors.

---

### I. Color Matching Algorithm Optimizations

The color matching process is the most computationally expensive part of the `generate_gem_art` function. The following optimizations target this area directly.

**1. Pre-computation of Lab Colors:**

*   **Problem:** The list of DMC colors is converted from sRGB to Lab color space on every call to `generate_gem_art`. This is a redundant calculation.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Pre-calculate the Lab color values for the entire DMC color palette once and store them. This can be done at application startup or even at compile time.
*   **Expected Impact:** This should provide a significant performance improvement by eliminating the repeated color space conversions.

**2. K-d Tree for Nearest Neighbor Search:**

*   **Problem:** The current implementation finds the closest color by iterating through the entire list of colors for every pixel in the image. This is an O(n) operation for each pixel, where n is the number of colors.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Use a k-d tree or a similar spatial data structure to store the Lab color values. This will allow for a much faster nearest neighbor search, with an average time complexity of O(log n).
*   **Expected Impact:** This is likely to be the most significant optimization, especially for large color palettes.

### II. Image Processing Optimizations

**1. Parallelize Pixel Processing with Rayon:**

*   **Problem:** The pixel processing loop is currently single-threaded.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Use the `rayon` crate to parallelize the iteration over the pixels. Each pixel can be processed independently, making this a perfect candidate for parallelization.
*   **Expected Impact:** This should provide a significant performance improvement on multi-core processors.

### III. Workflow for Applying and Testing Optimizations

For each optimization attempted, the following workflow will be followed:

1.  **Implement the optimization.**
2.  **Run `cargo check`** to ensure the code compiles without errors.
3.  **Run `cargo test`** to ensure all existing tests pass.
4.  **Run `cargo bench`** to measure the performance impact of the change.
5.  **Analyze the results:**
    *   If the change results in a significant performance improvement, it will be kept.
    *   If the change results in a performance regression or no significant improvement, it will be reverted.
